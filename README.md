<br> Explore Pt. 3: 1. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are good for checking if individual functions/components work correctly. They can check for bugs from individual functions.
                    2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because I can test if a function prevents messages longer than 80 characters, allow messages less than 80 characters, and allow messages that are exactly 80 characters.
